# Cs-149-persistent-list
The purpose of this assignment is to create a persistent list of strings in a file(.dat). This program uses mmap.
Only usable on Linnix, not portable
To use these files, compile the .c and run ./binaryName fileName or ./binaryName -t filename. -t is a temporary flag and changes will not be carried out to the underlying file.
supports add list and delete operations

Ex:
add: a cat
list: l
delete: d cat
