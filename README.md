# Cs-149-persistent-list
The purpose of this assignment is to create a persistent list of strings in a file(.dat).
Only usable on Unix, not portable
To use these files, compile the .c and run ./binaryName fileName or ./binaryName -t filename. -t is a temporary flag and changes will not be carried out to underlying file. Ensure the header file is in the same directory as the binary and .c file.
